# Overview 
Now that we‚Äôve covered the three most fundamental concepts in programming let's look into how we can structure our code. You have already learnt the necessary skills to create basic programs üßë‚Äçüíª that will work perfectly well, as you will see in the coming tutorials. Now we are going to cover the two slightly more advanced concepts, Functions and Object-Oriented Programming. 

To understand the importance of functions we can liken their role to contractors üë∑ building a house in the real-world. We use specialised contractors such as electricians, plumbers and carpenters to complete specialised work (in this analogy each worker represents a function), if later down the line there is a problem with the plumbing you only need to call the plumber (function), not redo the entire house üè†. This modular approach ensures efficiency and re-useability, in contrast not using functions would be like building a house alone, tackling every task yourself which would be disorganised and challenging üò∞. 

We only need to understand the basics of Object-Oriented Programming which we will cover after we‚Äôve covered functions in more depth. Many developers actually prefer a function-based approach to programming than using OOP, but it is still important to understand the basics. OOP essentially comprises the previous concepts we‚Äôve already covered.

# Guide
Functions are a core concept in programming, they apply to practically every language. When you are writing programs you can choose to either write them in a functional approach (often easier and quicker) or an object-orientated approach (requires more code but sometimes better for larger projects). In Pi-Guard we will use a functional approach but we will be using pre-built code that is written in an OOP approach. Therefore understanding both methodologies is crucial.

#### Functions
Functions are a fantastic feature, they allow you to wrap code in a callable 'function' that you can execute on demand! Think of a function like a receipe in cooking. It needs a name to identify it, it might need inputs like ingredients, then there is a method, in which the inputs (ingredients) are taken and processed to make something new!

#### Object Orientated Programming (OOP)
Object orientated programming is simply a different approach to programming. It essentially comprises of all of the concepts that we've already learnt about put together. OOP consists of two main concepts: **classes** and **objects**. We create objects out of classes. We can model almost anything in the real world as a class (which you can think of as a blueprint) and then we create specific objects out of those classes (or blueprints). An example might be a car class and then an object of that class might be a specific BMW.

**Function example:**
```
# Name of function and "parameters" (inputs in brackets)
def bake_cake(flour, eggs, sugar):

    # Mix all the ingredients 
    cake = flour + eggs + sugar  
  
    # Output the value of the calculation above  
    return cake  

# Call the function
my_cake = bake_cake(1,2,3)

print(my_cake)
```
Can you guess what the above code (function) will do? Copy the code and try it out in your VS Code!

#### Object-Orientated Programming
Object-Orientated Programming (often referred to as OOP) is a different approach to programming, that is not always better. 

It bundles the concepts above (variables, loops, functions) into a package that is known as a "class" or blueprint. 

It is not essential to have an in-depth understanding of this concept for Pi-Spy, and many problems that you encounter can be solved without this concept.

**Object-Oriented Programming example:**
```
# Define the Class (Generic Blueprint)
class Dog:

    # Specify some attributes in the form of variables
    def init(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age


    # Specify an action in the form of a function  
    def bark(self):  
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"  

# Create an object of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Fido", 2)

# Call the bark method
print(my_dog.bark())  # Outputs: Fido says woof!
```

Hopefully you can notice above that the Dog "class" or blueprint, is comprised of variables (name & age) and a function that returns a bark message.

    self.age = age

    def bark(self):  
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"  

# Create an object of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Fido", 2)

# Call the bark method
print(my_dog.bark())  # Outputs: Fido says woof!
