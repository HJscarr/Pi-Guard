# Introduction 
Integrated Development Environments or (IDEs) are where Developers write their code.
Just as you'd use a word processor (Microsoft Word) if you wanted to write an essay, you would use an IDE (VS Code) if you wanted to write some code.

# Guide
Technically speaking VS Code is a 'Code Editor' rather than an IDE, but the line between them is 
blurring as light-weight code editors now have much of the functionality that IDEs have.

Simply download Visual Studio Code and Python below and follow the installation process.

### Downloads
Download VS Code Link: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Download Python Link: [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Visual Studio Code is a powerful software tool. 


### VS Code Sections
The left panel of VS Code is File Explorer, similar to File Explorer on Windows or Finder on MacOS. This is where you can see your files and folders.

The bottom section is a Terminal, similar to Command Line on Windows or Terminal on MacOS. This is where you can execute commands, like running a program.

The central section is editor itself, this is where you can view the contents of a file and edit it.

### Process
Once you have installed both VS Code and Python simply enter the code in the section below and run:

`python3 example.py` in the terminal

You should see Hello world printed in the terminal.
