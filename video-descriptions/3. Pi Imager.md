# Introduction 
Operating Systems are the core of advanced computing devices. Just as your laptop might be running on Windows OS or MacOS, the Raspberry Pi Zero needs an operating system to run. We will be using Raspberry Pi Imager to install Raspberry Pi OS onto the Raspberry Pi Zero v2.

# Guide
1. To install Raspberry Pi OS onto the Raspberry Pi we must download an install Pi Imager:
Download Link: [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

2. Once downloaded and installed please enter the SD Card into your laptop, using the provided SD card adapter.

3. Next open the Pi Imager software, select Raspberry Pi OS Lite (This has no desktop interface), you may choose raspberry Pi OS Full if you'd like to connect a keyboard and mouse and control the Pi directly.

4. Select the 16GB SD card as the memory. 

5. Select the settings/gear icon in the bottom right. Keep the hostname as raspberrypi.local, unless there are more than one of you setting this up on the same WiFi. In which case call it something unique and memorable.

6. Follow the video carefully and enter a **unique and memorable** username and password. You will need these later!

7. Next enter the SSID (Name) and Password of your WiFi that your laptop is connected to.

8. Finally, click **save** and then **write**!

9. After powering the raspberry pi and waiting 5 minutes for it to boot up correctly enter:
`ping raspberrypi.local` or `ping hostname.local` (if you selected a different hostname in step 5)
