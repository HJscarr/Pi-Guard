# Introduction 
To capture motion üèÉ we will be using a Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensor. These detect radiation in the form of infra-red that are emitted by humans. The change in infra-red is what triggers these sensors. They are ubiquitous in home security systems and automatic lighting systems.

# Guide
The PIR sensor has two physical dials. When looking at the sensor with the dome on the top the left dial controls the time the signal is output, e.g. once an object is detected should the sensor output a signal for 5 or 10 seconds? The right dial is the distance the sensor can sense up to.

To setup the PIR sensor for Pi-Spy (when looking at the sensor with the dome on the top):
1. Turn the left dial anti-clockwise just under 90 degrees
2. Turn the right dial clock-wise just under 90 degrees, when you are complete these should be almost symmetrical, feel free to experiment with these dials for this tutorial, but place them in this position when you are done
3. Copy the diagram in the video to connect the respective pins on the PIR sensor to the Pi Zero's GPIO pins using the cables provided. (*You can remove the white dome on the PIR sensor to determine which pin is for 5V, Ground or GPIO if needed*)
4. Next ensure you are connected to the Pi using the SSH by clicking the connection symbol in the bottom left and entering the password to your Pi
5. Create a new Python file called `CaptureMotion.py` either through the Terminal or using the *Create file* icon near the top of the explorer window on the left (As shown in the video)
6. Enter the code from the section below into the Python file
7. **Ensure that the sensor (white dome) is facing away from you before running the program**
8. Once you run the program, wait 30 seconds for the sensor to calibrate and wave your hand üëã in-front of the sensor

# Code
####captureMotion.py
```
from gpiozero import MotionSensor


pir = MotionSensor(4)


pir.wait_for_motion()


print("Motion Detected!")
```
