I hope that you enjoyed the process of building the device, I’m sure there were times that were a struggle and not everything worked as you expected, however I hope that there were times of elation 😁 when a piece of code ran successfully and it finally worked! 

Perhaps now you can appreciate why programming 🧑‍💻 has one of the highest job satisfaction rates, or maybe it's just to do with the flexible work hours and great compensation 💷!

I would like to personally thank you 🙏 for taking the time to complete this course. If you did enjoy 🤩 it I would greatly appreciate it if you shared your experience with your friends and family, or even mention to us on social media we are a small company and your recommendation would go a long way! 

Finally if you could complete the short [questionnaire](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 🙋 below the video in the description it will give us an idea 💡 of how we can improve this course for future 🔮 people like you. Feel free to offer suggestions of what we should build & teach 🧑‍🏫 next. From all of us at JamByte, thank you very much and keep building!

# Course Recap
Throughout the course we have touched on many different tools, skills and concepts that have enabled us to build this spy device. 🕵️

Firstly we learnt about **code editors** and discovered where professional developers write their code. 

Then we looking into **operating systems** and learnt about **Raspberry Pi OS** which is almost identical to the **Linux** systems that are used by professional developers every-day.

We then delved into **networking** and discovered **SSH** as a tool to connect to and control our Raspberry Pi device. We got our hands dirty using the **BASH** shell which we used to issue commands to our device, such as creating new files or navigating through folders. We even touched on **Bash Scripts** which are used to **automate** manual processes.

Next we discovered the world of **Python libraries** including the power & ease of use they bring to our **Python programs**, enabling us to record audio with just a few lines of code.

Then we covered the fundamental concepts of **programming** which we applied in **Python**, enabling us to capture motion!

Finally we covered the importance of good **documentation** and tied the previous concepts and skills that we learnt together into a larger program that can record audio when it detects motion.

We hope that the next time you encounter an automatic light system or some form of electronic device you have some idea of how it was built. Remember the world was built by people no smarter than you are!
