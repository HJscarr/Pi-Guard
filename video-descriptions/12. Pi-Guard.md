# Overview
Now we‚Äôve completed each of the individual components necessary for the course. We have a fully functioning micro-computer that we can connect & control, create & run python üêç programs and we have the microphone üé§, buzzer, camera, and motion sensor all setup and working. 

All we have to do is combine the functionality that we‚Äôve already implemented and we will have a fully functioning home security device üëÆ. This modular approach to solving small problems and then piecing them together is exactly how professional developers üßë‚Äçüíª in the real-world approach huge problems.

We are going to reuse practically all the code we‚Äôve written to build our final device, code reuse is looked upon very favourably ‚úÖ in Computer Science as it improves speed, consistency and often quality.

# Guide
Often completing a project is actually the shortest part of it. Especially once all of the functionality has already been built. 

For the final time ensure that you are inside the Pi-Guard folder and then create a file called `pi-guard.py` using the touch BASH command.

The Python file should contain the code detailed in the section below.

Congratulations!!! üçæüëèü•≥ You have built a fully functioning home security device, with some electronics and some magical code ü™Ñ‚ú®

# Code
####pi-guard.py:
```
import subprocess
import threading
from picamera import PiCamera
from gpiozero import Buzzer, MotionSensor
from time import sleep, strftime
from datetime import datetime

# Set up the motion sensor and buzzer
pir = MotionSensor(4)
buzzer = Buzzer(16)

# Function to record audio
def record_audio(duration, audio_file_path):
    subprocess.run(["arecord", "-D", "plughw:1,0", "-d", str(duration), "-f", "cd", audio_file_path])

# Function to record video with reduced resolution and frame rate
def record_video(duration, video_file, frame_rate):
    
    # Create camera object (OOP) and set resolution and frame-rate using methods
    camera = PiCamera()
    camera.resolution = (640, 480)
    camera.framerate = frame_rate
    
    # Record Video
    print("Starting video recording...")

    # Use PiCamera object methods to record for a specific time
    camera.start_recording(video_file)
    camera.wait_recording(duration)
    camera.stop_recording()
    camera.close()

    print(f"Video file recorded at {video_file}")

# Function to combine audio and video with specified frame rate

    command = [
        "ffmpeg", "-y",
        "-r", str(frame_rate),

        "-strict", "experimental",
        final_output_path
    ]
    subprocess.run(command, check=True)

def main():
    # Set a recording duration & then wait for motion...
    duration = 10
    frame_rate = 12
    pir.wait_for_motion()
    print("Motion detected!!! Starting recording...")

    # Sound buzzer for 2 seconds to signal start recording
    buzzer.on()
    sleep(2)
    buzzer.off()

    # Generate unique file names with timestamp
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%d-%m-%H:%M")
    audio_file = f"/home/js17/audio_{timestamp}.wav"
    video_file = f"/home/js17/video_{timestamp}.h264"
    final_output = f"/home/js17/output_{timestamp}.mp4"

    # Start recording
    audio_thread = threading.Thread(target=record_audio, args=(duration, audio_file))
    video_thread = threading.Thread(target=record_video, args=(duration, video_file, frame_rate))

    audio_thread.start()
    video_thread.start()

    audio_thread.join()
    video_thread.join()

    # Combine audio and video
    combine_audio_video(audio_file, video_file, final_output, frame_rate)
    print(f"Combined video file created at: {final_output}")

# Start the program
main()
```
