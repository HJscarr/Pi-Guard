# Introduction 
Let's combine what we've learnt and the programs we've built to make the final spy device. üïµÔ∏è
We've taken a modular approach to building this device, which is exactly how professional engineers approach the worlds largest problems. We broke the motion sensing and recording capabilities down into separate problems and solved each one. Now lets put what we've learnt together and get the device up and running. ‚ú®

# Guide
Before combining the code, we can increase the sensitivity of the microphone, you may skip this step if you feel your microphone is sensitive enough.

#### Increasing the sensitivity of the microphone (make recordings louder)
Ensure you are connected to the Pi before completing the following:
1. In the terminal type `alsamixer`
2. Press Fn + F6, or click on the right *F6: Select sound card* option
3. Choose the USB PnP Sound Device by scrolling down or clicking on it
4. Press Tab followed by the up arrow to increase the sensitivity of the microphone, press esc to save this when completed

#### Combining the motion detection and recording capabilities
Ensure you are connected to the Pi before completing the following:
1. Create a new Python file called `piSpy.py`
2. Follow the code implementation in the video (recommended) or copy and paste the code from the section below
3. Now ensuring that the PIR motion sensor is facing away from your body you can start the program

Congratulations!!! üçæüëèü•≥ You have built a fully functioning spy bug, with some electronics and some magical code ü™Ñ‚ú®

# Code
####piSpy.py:
```
# First import the modules, pyaudio for recording, gpiozero for motion
import pyaudio
import wave
from gpiozero import MotionSensor
from datetime import datetime

# Set up the motion sensor with the GPIO pin it is plugged into on the board
pir = MotionSensor(4)

def appendAudio(t, stream, chunk, frames):
    flagged = False
    # loop through stream and append audio chunks to frame array
    for i in range(0,t):
        data = stream.read(chunk, exception_on_overflow=False)
        frames.append(data)
        if (pir.motion_detected):  
            flagged = True
    if (flagged):
        flagged = False
        appendAudio(t, stream, chunk, frames)
    

def recordAudio():
    # Set up the audio settings for recording
    form_1 = pyaudio.paInt16 # 16-bit resolution
    chans = 1 # 1 channel
    samp_rate = 44100 # 44.1kHz sampling rate
    chunk = 4096 # 2^12 samples for buffer
    record_secs = 60 # seconds to record
    dev_index = 0 # device index found by p.get_device_info_by_index(ii)
    now = datetime.now() # get today's date and time
    dt_string = now.strftime("%d|%m|%Y-%H:%M") # format the date and time correctly
    wav_output_filename = dt_string+'.wav' # name of .wav file
    audio = pyaudio.PyAudio() # create pyaudio instantiation
    global flagged
    flagged = False

    t = int((samp_rate/chunk)*record_secs)

    # create pyaudio stream
    stream = audio.open(format = form_1,rate = samp_rate,channels = chans, \
                        input_device_index = dev_index,input = True, \
                        frames_per_buffer=chunk)
    print("recording")
    frames = []

    appendAudio(t, stream, chunk, frames)

    print("finished recording")

    # stop the stream, close it, and terminate the pyaudio instantiation
    stream.stop_stream()
    stream.close()
    audio.terminate()

    # save the audio frames as .wav file
    wavefile = wave.open(wav_output_filename,'wb')
    wavefile.setnchannels(chans)
    wavefile.setsampwidth(audio.get_sample_size(form_1))
    wavefile.setframerate(samp_rate)
    wavefile.writeframes(b''.join(frames))
    wavefile.close()

pir.wait_for_motion()
print("Motion detected!!! Starting recording...")

recordAudio()
```
