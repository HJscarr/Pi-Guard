# Introduction 
We need to connect to and control the device. To accomplish this we will use Secure SHell (SSH). This is a protocol commonly seen in Computer Science that enables two devices to connect and control one another. They must be on the same network (WiFi). To do this will need the IP address of the device, which you can think of as your house address in the computer world.

# Guide
Firstly we need the IP address which tells us the "position" and "path" to reach the Raspberry Pi, similarly to how your house address tells others the position and path of how to reach your house.

**The process explained below can be used if you haven't used your Pi for a while and need to re-connect.**

1. Enter: `ping raspberrypi.local` or `ping hostname.local` (if you selected a different hostname), an IP address should appear, similar to: *192.168.1.232*

2. Select the "extensions" symbol on the very left of your screen, and search `remote ssh`. Select the one with the largest number of downloads (usually top) and install it.

3. Select the small blue symbol in the bottom left corner of VS Code. This should prompt a pop-up up in the top middle of your screen in which you select 'Connect to Host'.

4. Select *add new host* and enter `ssh Username@IpAddress` (where Username was the username you chose in the previous video and IpAddress is the number obtained in step one).

5. Press enter and then select the first config file in the list, next click connect in the bottom right pop-up.

6. A new smaller screen will pop-up, click *continue* and then enter the password that you chose in the previous video.

7. The bottom left of your screen should now read "SSH: IpAddress" which indicates you are connected to the Pi, well done! üéâüëè

Now if you once again open terminal at the top of your screen, you should notice a green name similar to `pi@raspberrypi:` or whatever you called your device.

Follow the foundational linux commands to get a taster of BASH, don't worry too much if you don't understand these just yet, we're going to cover them in more depth next...

# Code
#### In Terminal
`mkdir my-first-folder` = Creates a folder called 'my-first-folder' (like clicking create folder on Finder or File Explorer)

`cd my-first-folder` = Moves into the folder 'my-first-folder' (like clicking into a folder on Finder or File Explorer)

`touch helloworld.py` = Creates a Python file called 'helloworld.py' (like clicking new file on Finder or File Explorer)

`cd ..` = Moves backwards out of that folder (like clicking back on Finder or File Explorer)
