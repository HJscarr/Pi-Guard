# Overview
Generally to control a computer you plug a keyboard ⌨️, mouse 🖱️ and screen 🖥️ directly into the computer which allows you to use it. However, our device has no screen, keyboard or mouse attached to it. Therefore we need to control our device remotely, we will use our computer to remotely connect to and control the device we’re building.

This is incredibly common in the world of technology, Cloud Computing 🌥️ is the perfect example of this. The majority of computing actually happens in data centres, which are giant warehouses 🏢 full of computers (imagine our raspberry pi but much more powerful stacked upon each other). To remotely access and control this device we are going to use a protocol called SSH (which stands for Secure SHell).

Let's break down those two terms as they’re important. Protocol’s are simply a set of rules that computers follow to communicate with each other over a network 🛜. Just like the rules of a game make sure everyone knows what to do, protocols mean that computers can talk to one another without confusion. The protocol that we’ll be using in this instance is SSH, this is like having a secret passageway 🤐 between your computer and the device, it allows you to control a computer remotely.

# Guide
Firstly we need the IP address which tells us the "position" and "path" to reach the Raspberry Pi, similarly to how your house address tells others the position and path of how to reach your house.

**The process explained below can be used if you haven't used your Pi for a while and need to re-connect.**


1. Enter: `ping [Your Initials][Your birthdate].local` which in my case is `js17.local` or `ping hostname.local` (if you selected a different hostname), an IP address should appear, similar to: *192.168.1.232* press the CONTROL key on your keyboard and the C key at the same time to stop the text appearing in the terminal.


2. Select the "extensions" symbol on the very left of your screen, and search `remote ssh`. Select the one with the largest number of downloads (usually top) and install it.

3. Select the small blue symbol in the bottom left corner of VS Code. This should prompt a pop-up up in the top middle of your screen in which you select 'Connect to Host'.

4. Select *add new host* and enter `ssh Username@IpAddress` (where Username was the username you chose when setting up Pi Imager and IpAddress is the number obtained in step one).

5. Press enter and then select the first config file in the list, next click connect in the bottom right pop-up.

6. A new smaller screen will pop-up, click *continue* and then enter the password that you chose in the previous video.

7. The bottom left of your screen should now read "SSH: IpAddress" which indicates you are connected to the Pi, well done! 🎉👏


Now if you once again open the terminal at the top of your screen, you should notice a green name similar to `pi@raspberrypi:` or whatever you called your device.

Always make sure that the explorer window is open by clicking explorer on the left panel at the top and select Open Remote. Then select OK in the pop up that appears in the top middle section of VS code to open your home folder on your raspberry pi. Once again you'll have to select continue followed by the password you set for your raspberry pi. Finally open a new terminal by selecting terminal at the top of your screen and selecting new terminal.

**Whenever you are using VS Code connected to your Pi you should have the home folder open on the left and the terminal open at the bottom as we've done here**

Follow the foundational linux commands to get a taster of BASH, don't worry too much if you don't understand these just yet, we're going to cover them in more depth later...

# Code
#### In Terminal
`sudo apt-get update` = Gets a list of files that need to be updated

`sudo apt-get upgrade` = Upgrades the files in the last that the raspberry pi fetched in the previous step

# Troubleshooting

### If `ping hostname.local` doesn't work
If your ping command doesn't work it is because your Raspberry Pi has either not started successfully, or because it has not connected to your WiFi successfully. 

*Please wait for 5 minutes after you have plugged your Raspberry Pi into the power for it to boot up and connect to the internet*. 

If you cannot reach your Raspberry Pi after five minutes please consider the following:

It is most likely caused by incorrectly entering your WiFi's name and password. The name and password are case sensitive (capitalisation matters) and spaces also matter. Repeat tutorial **3. Pi Imager** and enter these details with extra care. 

Check the green light on the raspberry pi after it has been powered on for more than five minutes. If it is flashing consistently it indicates that the hardware might be faulty, please contact us in this rare situation.

### If the SSH connection doesn't work
If you can successfully use the `ping hostname.local` command and it responds with an IP address then well done! This means that your Raspberry Pi has started successfully and is connected to your WiFi.

If the SSH connection using VS code then doesn't work it is most likely because you entered the incorrect details in the previous tutorial **(3. Pi Imager)**. 

We recommend re-completing the previous tutorial and taking extra care to set the hostname as identical to the username (which should be something unique like your initials followed by your birthdate) and choose a password that you enter with care. *Also please make sure to **enable SSH** in the middle tab of the settings in Pi Imager*

**Before attempting to connect to your Raspberry Pi Using SSH please do the following**

1. Enter `sudo rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts` into your terminal in VS Code
2. Enter in your **laptop/computer** password if asked for it (the password you normally use to log into your laptop/computer NOT the one you chose in Pi Imager)
3. Click *Open a remote window* in the bottom left of VS Code
4. Select *Connect to remote host* at the top middle section of your screen
5. Select *Configure SSH Hosts...* in the dropdown menu
6. Select the first option from the next drop down (which you can do by pressing enter)
7. Remove all of the text in the file that appears
8. Click File > Save 

You are now ready to attempt to connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH!
