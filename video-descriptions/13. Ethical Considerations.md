# Overview
The device that we’ve built is not only technically advanced but also highly capable in terms of its processing power 🔋 and sensory equipment. We have equipped our device with a camera 📸, microphone, and a Passive Infra-Red (PIR) motion sensor. This combination allows it to capture a wealth of data from the world 🌍 around it.

While these features make our device an excellent tool for home security, they also bring up serious ethical questions 🙋 and legal responsibilities. With great power comes great responsibility, and this principle applies to technology 📱 as much as anything else. As budding engineers and inventors 🧑‍💻, it's crucial for you to understand the implications of using such powerful technology, especially when it involves recording audio and video.

In the UK, the use of recording devices, especially in a public or semi-public context, is governed by several laws 🧑‍⚖️ and regulations. These include the Data Protection Act 2018, which aligns with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, and the Human Rights Act 1998.

# Guide
Here are some key considerations:
1. **Privacy:** It's important to ensure that anyone who might be recorded by your device is aware of it. This is especially significant in areas where individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy.
2. **Purpose Limitation:** The data captured by this device should be used strictly for the intended purpose, in this case, home security. Using the recordings for any other purpose, especially without consent, could be unethical and illegal.
3. **Data Protection and Security:** Any data captured, particularly personal data like images or audio recordings, must be securely stored and protected. Unauthorised access to this data can have serious privacy implications.
4. **Transparency and Accountability:** People should be informed about what data is being captured, how it's being used, and who will have access to it. This includes clear signage if the device is used in a semi-public area like the entrance to a home.
5. **Respect for Neighbours and Public Spaces:** When installing such devices, it's important to consider the privacy of neighbours and others who might inadvertently be recorded, especially if the device captures beyond the boundaries of your own property.
6. **Retention and Deletion of Data:** There should be clear guidelines on how long the recorded data is kept and when and how it is to be securely deleted.
