# Introduction 
As we are controlling the Pi Zero through the terminal (rather than a standard GUI) we need to learn some powerful commands! Instead of visual icons that you click on to run programs you simply type text into the terminal to execute the running of programs. You can do anything in the terminal that you could do visually! For this we will be using the **Bourne-Again Shell** (BASH).

# Guide
BASH commands can be used to open folders, create new folders or files, run programs and much more.
You can run these commands individually, one at a time in the terminal.

However, you can also create *bash scripts* which are a collection of these commands. For example if you wanted to open a folder and get a list of every file inside that folder you could run the commands manually one-by-one, or you could place the commands in a *bash script* and run it on a loop. This is the start of **DevOps**, and the process of automating manual tasks. Companies pay millions of pounds every year for these skills.

# Code

`pwd` = Lists current location (which folder/directory you are currently in)

`touch bashscript.sh` = Creates a file called *bashscript.sh*

`nano bashscript.sh` = Opens editing mode on *bashscript.sh*

####bashscript.sh:
```
#!/bin/bash


mkdir my-second-folder


cd my-second-folder


touch hello-world2.py


cd ..


ls
```


`mkdir my-second-folder` = Creates a folder called my-second-folder

`cd my-second-folder` = Enters into my-second-folder (like double clicking on a folder on Windows or MacOS)

`touch hello-world2.py` = Creates a file called hello-world2.py

`cd ..` = Moves backwards out of the current folder (like clicking back out of a folder in Windows or MacOS)

`ls` = Lists all files in the current folder/directory you are in
