# Overview
Now that youâ€™ve completed Pi-Guard you might feel as though there is nothing left to do, this couldnâ€™t be further from the truth.

There are two main routes that you could now explore ðŸ§­, the first is improvements on Pi-Guard, such as adding new functionality or editing the existing code and the second is building a new project entirely ðŸ’­ from the components you already have.

In the field of technology nothing is ever perfected, engineers are constantly iterating and improving existing code and electronics âš¡ and your approach should be the same with this project. Let's look at the first point, improving our existing code. Weâ€™ll add some additional functionality to our device that will enable us to **continually** record audio & video when motion is detected, a simple improvement that adds great functionality.

# Guide
Suggestions for future improvements include:
   a) Improving this project, or altering the functionality
   b) Creating something new entirely from the components you have

Let's briefly look into (a)


#### Recording when people leave and re-enter the room
If you wish to extend the capability of your home security device to record whenever people re-enter the room after sometime (rather than just recording for a single session) then simply follow the steps below:
1) Ensure you are connected to the Pi
2) Edit the `pi-guard.py` file to include the code in the section below ðŸ‘‡ (essentially just adding a while True block to the bottom of the code)


#### Recording autonomously when the Pi boots up (removing the need for an internet connection)
To begin recording when the raspberry pi is plugged in (rather than having to login and manually run the pi-guard.py program) we can add a script that runs the program when the Pi boots up. This removes the need for an internet connection when the Pi is recording. (You will still need the internet to be able to listen to the files).
1) Ensure you are connected to the Pi, add `#!/usr/bin/env python3` to the top of the pi-guard.py program and save the file
2) Type `chmod +x [script-path]` where script path is the value you obtain by right clicking and selecting *copy path* on `pi-guard.py`
3) Enter `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/myscript.service` to edit the file
4) Add the code in the section below (myscript.service) to the file
5) Save the file with Control + X
6) Enter `sudo systemctl daemon-reload
7) Enter `sudo systemctl enable myscript.service`

Now when you plug in the Raspberry Pi the pi-guard program will automatically start

#### Methodology for building new devices
If you wish to explore (b) there are countless paths you could take. Instead of giving concrete suggestions we will provide a framework that we use to think of and build new devices.

Thought framework:
1) Identify a device you'd like to build, either through an existing problem that you or a friend have, or a cool product that you've seen like in this case [Listening device](https://www.spygadgets4u.co.uk/listening-devices/listening-device-voice-recorder-with-90-day-battery.html) which was the inspiration for Pi-Spy
2) Identify the capabilities that this device would need, (in our case that was detecting motion and recording audio)
3) Create a list of questions that you can enter into either Google (old-fashioned) or Chat-GPT (the future!)

> Learning to ask the right questions will be the single most important skill of the future
