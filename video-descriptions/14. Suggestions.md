# Introduction 
Congratulations on completing the core project! We hope you had a great time building something new and understand the value and power of what you have achieved. 
However, just because this project is working doesn't mean it can't be improved or frankinsteined into a new project completely!
The electronics you have are of exceptional quality and are quite frankly overkill for a project as small as this. Don't be afraid to build something bigger and better now you have a grasp on the fundementals!

# Guide
Suggestions for future improvements include:
    a) Improving this project, or altering the functionality
    b) Creating something new entirely from the components you have

Let's briefly look into (a)


#### Recording when people leave and re-enter the room
If you wish to extend the capability of your spy device to record whenever people re-enter the room after sometime (rather than just recording for a single session) then simply follow the steps below:
1) Ensure you are connected to the Pi
2) Edit the `piSpy.py` file to include the code in the section below ðŸ‘‡ (essentially just adding a while True block to the bottom of the code)


#### Recording autonomously when the Pi boots up (removing the need for an internet connection)
To begin recording when the raspberry pi is plugged in (rather than having to login and manually run the piSpy.py program) we can add a script that runs the program when the Pi boots up. This removes the need for an internet connection when the Pi is recording. (You will still need internet to be able to listen to the files).
1) Ensure you are connected to the Pi, add `#!/usr/bin/env python3` to the top of the piSpy.py program and save the file
2) Type `chmod +x [script-path]` where script path is the value you obtain by right clicking and selecting *copy path* on `piSpy.py`
3) Enter `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/myscript.service` to edit the file
4) Add the code in the section below (myscript.service) to the file
5) Save the file with Control + X
6) Enter `sudo systemctl enable myscript.service`

Now when you plug in the Raspberry Pi the script will automatically start

#### Methodology for building new devices
If you wish to explore (b) there are countless paths you could take. Instead of giving concrete suggestions we will provide a framework that we use to think of and build new devices.

Thought framework:
1) Identify a device you'd like to build, either through an existing problem that you or a friend have, or a cool product that you've seen like in this case [Listening device](https://www.spygadgets4u.co.uk/listening-devices/listening-device-voice-recorder-with-90-day-battery.html) which was the inspiration for Pi-Spy
2) Identify the capabilities that this device would need, (in our case that was detecting motion and recording audio)
3) Create a list of questions that you can enter into either Google (old-fashioned) or Chat-GPT (the future!) 

> Learning to ask the right questions will be the single most important skill of the future
