# Introduction 
To create a spy recording device we need to setup a microphone. It's incredibly simple to connect the microphone and you only need a few lines of Python code to get it up and running!ðŸŽ¤

---
# Guide
Simply plug the USB microphone adapter (which should already be connected to the USB microphone) into the Raspberry Pi Zero. **Ensure to connect it to the left of the two micro-usb ports** (when looking into them). That's the hardware setup! ðŸ™Œ

Next to test the functionality enter:
`arecord -D plughw:1,0 --duration=60 test.wave` into the Terminal. This should record for 60 seconds before creating and saving to a file named *test.wav*

#### Python Guide
1. To set this up in Python we first need to intall a few packages, Enter:
`sudo apt-get install libportaudio0 libportaudio2 libportaudiocpp0 portaudio19-dev` into the Terminal
2. Then install pip by entering: `sudo apt install python3-pip` into the Terminal
3. Next install pyaudio by entering `sudo pip3 install pyaudio` into the Terminal
4. Next create a new folder called PiSpy by entering `mkdir PiSpy` into the terminal and move into that folder by entering `cd PiSpy/`
5. Now create your python file by entering: `touch recordAudio.py`, edit this file by entering `code recordAudio.py`, or simply opening it in the file explorer on the left
6. Add the code in the section below to the Python file, hashtags in the code are comments that are not run by Python but explain to the user how the code works
7. Open up extensions on the left panel of VS Code and search for Python, this installs Python on the Raspberry Pi (We previously installed it on your local laptop/desktop computer)
8. Back in the `recordAudio.py` section of VS Code a small play button should have appeared in the top right, click this to run the program or simply type `python3 recordAudio.py`, if you chose to type then ensure you are in the same folder as the python program with `pwd`!

    frames.append(data)  
  
print("finished recording")  
  
# stop the stream, close it, and terminate the pyaudio instantiation  
stream.stop_stream()  
stream.close()  
audio.terminate()  
  
# save the audio frames as .wav file  
wavefile = wave.open(wav_output_filename,'wb')  
wavefile.setnchannels(chans)  
wavefile.setsampwidth(audio.get_sample_size(form_1))  
wavefile.setframerate(samp_rate)  
wavefile.writeframes(b''.join(frames))  
wavefile.close()
