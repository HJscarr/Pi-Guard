# Overview 
Clear documentation 📄 is an essential component of any developer's 🧑‍💻 code. Documentation is simply an explanation of the code you’ve written. It can be added alongside the code you write in “comments” or in an external file 📁 such as Confluence or GitHub. 

In my opinion comments directly in the code are the best form of documentation as they minimise the time ⏳ required for another developer, or more likely you in 10 months time, to understand the code you wrote. It’s very common to come back to a program you wrote many months later 🕰️ and have little to no clue 🕵️ how it works. 

If you ever become a software engineer 🧑‍💻 for a professional company you will be working in a team and therefore it is incredibly important for other engineers to be able to read 🧑‍🏫, comment and improve the code you write. Therefore this is an essential skill to develop. The aim here is to write the clearest and most concise explanation of your code.

# Guide

Writing and reading documentation is an essential skill for a programmer.

Using #'s in Python allows us to write a human-readable description of our code within the code file.

However you can also write a separate document in GitHub or even microsoft word explaining your code if it is a complicated project.

As a beginner it is a great idea to add comments through your code so you understand it more clearly. 

It is also really important to be able to find and read through documentation to understand how existing programs that you are using work. The most common of these will be the [GPIO Docs](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which gives a fantastic guide on which sensors can be used with your Raspberry Pi Zero and how the Python code works for them!

The code for turning the buzzer off when there is motion and turning it on when there is no motion is detailed below.

# Code
####buzz-when-no-motion.py:
```
from gpiozero import MotionSensor, Buzzer
import time

# Initialize the MotionSensor and Buzzer
pir = MotionSensor(4)
bz = Buzzer(16)

while True:
    if pir.motion_detected:
        bz.off()
    else:
        bz.on()
    time.sleep(0.1) # Add a short delay to reduce CPU usage
```
